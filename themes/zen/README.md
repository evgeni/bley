The zen and zen-based themes are very customizable, so to make these themes
work, you have to use the sample config file. The theme uses Font Awesome v5
icons.

Three variants of Zen are available:

* `zen`, based on Mako templates
* `zen-jinja`, based on Jinja2 templates
* `zen-forkawesome`, using ForkAwesome icons instead of FontAwesome, based on Mako Templates

Enjoy!

**WARNING:** The themes use Less for their styles, but you don't need a Less compiler installed to use it.
