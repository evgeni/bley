ABOUT
=====
`bley` is an intelligent greylisting daemon for Postfix (and Exim).

It uses various test (incl. RBL and SPF) to decide whether a sender
should be greylisted or not, thus mostly eliminating the usual
greylisting delay while still filtering most of the spam.

DEPENDENCIES
============
`bley` is written in [Python](http://python.org) using the
[Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) framework. It uses
[pyspf](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyspf) for SPF validation and
[publicsuffix](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/publicsuffix) for checking
of domains against the [PublicSuffix.org](http://publicsuffix.org)
database. Database interaction is implemented via
[sqlite3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) for SQLite,
[psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) for PostgreSQL and
[MySQL-Python](http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/) for MySQL.

INSTALLATION
============

Quick and dirty
---------------
Unpack the tarball (or clone the git tree), adjust `bley.conf.template`,
rename it to `bley.conf` and run `./bley`.

Still quick, but not dirty
--------------------------
Unpack the tarball (or clone the git tree), run `python setup.py build`
followed by `python setup.py install`, copy `/etc/bley/bley.conf.template`
to `/etc/bley/bley.conf`, adjust it to your needs (see CONFIGURATION below)
and run `/usr/bin/bley`.

CONFIGURATION
=============
Basically you just have to configure the database:

    dbtype = pgsql for PostgreSQL, mysql for MySQL or sqlite3 for SQLite
    dbhost = the host where the database runs on (usually localhost)
    dbuser = the name of the database user
    dbpass = the password of the database user
    dbname = the name (or path in case of SQLite) of the database

After that you can point your Postfix to `bley` as a 
[policy server](http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html) by
adding `check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:1337` to your
`smtpd_recipient_restrictions` in `main.cf`.

`bley` will be working now, but you probably would like to tune it more
for your needs (esp. the used DNWLs and DNSBLs, the greylisting times
and the hit thresholds).
