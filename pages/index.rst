about
=====

**bley** is an intelligent greylisting daemon for Postfix. It uses various test (incl. RBL and SPF) to decide whether a sender should be greylisted or not,
thus mostly eliminating the usual greylisting delay while still filtering most of the spam.
 
**bley** was developed during my `bachelor's thesis at the Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf <http://www.cn.hhu.de/publikationen.html?publication=Golov2009a>`_ (`PDF </Golov2009a.pdf>`_ `XML </Golov2009a.xml>`_ `BibTeX </Golov2009a.bib>`_) and now continues to grow as my time permits.
